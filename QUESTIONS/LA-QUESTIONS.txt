2. Copy all the c and python program files (.c and .py files) into the above folder.
3. Navigate to /tmp folder.
4. Use the tar command to compress the Backup folder into a gz compressed tar archive name Backup-2025-03-28.tar.gz
5. Mount your pendrive using usdiskctl command.
(assume your pendrive is connected to the PC)
6. Move the archive Backup-2025-03-28.tar.gz to pendrive.

7. Unmount the pendrive.
